## Monorepo at a Glance

Raypx relies on Turborepo and pnpm workspaces. Applications live in `apps/`, reusable logic in `packages/`, and tooling in `tooling/`.

```text
raypx/
├── apps/
│   └── web/                # TanStack Start frontend
│       ├── src/app/        # File-based routes (React Server Components)
│       ├── src/components/ # Colocated UI primitives
│       ├── src/lib/        # Frontend utilities & adapters
│       └── public/         # Static assets served by the app
├── packages/               # Shared, versioned packages
├── tooling/                # Scripts & shared TypeScript configs
└── turbo.json              # Turborepo pipeline definition
```

Each package is published internally and imported via the `@raypx/*` namespace that pnpm configures automatically.

## Applications

- **apps/web** – TanStack Start application that renders the public and authenticated UI. Routes live under `apps/web/src/app` using the `{-$lang}` convention for i18n.

## Core Packages

| Package | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `packages/ui` | Design system built on Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Provides theme-aware components used across apps. |
| `packages/i18n` | Centralizes locale data, navigation helpers, and routing utilities. |
| `packages/db` | Database layer powered by Drizzle ORM, plus migration helpers. |
| `packages/shared` | Cross-cutting utilities, constants, and TypeScript types. |
| `packages/trpc` | Type-safe API procedures and server utilities. |
| `packages/redis` | Redis client configuration and caching helpers. |

Packages can depend on each other, but keep boundaries clear: UI only exposes presentation logic, while `shared` is for pure utilities with zero runtime dependencies.

## Tooling Highlights

- **`tooling/scripts/`** – Reusable scripts invoked by pnpm commands (formatting, linting, migrations).
- **`tooling/tsconfig/`** – Shared TypeScript configs used by packages and apps.
- **`biome.json`** – Single source of truth for linting and formatting via Biome.

## Generated Sources

Runtime metadata (such as MDX-driven docs) is generated into `apps/web/source.generated.ts`. Avoid manual edits—run document-related commands or rerun the dev server to refresh the file.

## Navigation Tips

- Use `pnpm --filter <package>` to target builds/tests for a specific package.
- `pnpm turbo run build --filter=apps/web` builds only the frontend while respecting dependency graphs.
- `pnpm -w <command>` executes workspace-level scripts, such as `pnpm -w format`.
