## What is Raypx?

Raypx is a Turborepo-powered monorepo that hosts a TanStack Start application, shared packages, and tooling aligned around AI-centric product development.
It provides a fully type-safe React 19 stack, opinionated UI components, and infrastructure helpers so teams can ship features quickly without rebuilding platform
primitives.

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure the following tools are installed:

- **Node.js** 20 or newer (LTS recommended)
- **pnpm** 10.17 or newer
- **Git** for version control

> Tip: run `node --version` and `pnpm --version` to double-check your local versions.

## First-Time Setup

```bash title="Clone and bootstrap the project"
git clone https://github.com/raypx/raypx.git
cd raypx
pnpm install
```

```bash title="Configure environment variables"
cp .env.example .env.local
# Update the new file with environment-specific values
```

```bash title="Run database migrations (optional)"
pnpm db:migrate
```

```bash title="Start the development server"
pnpm web:dev
# or pnpm dev to run all affected apps
```

The web app is available at `http://localhost:3000`. Hot-module reloading and TanStack's file-based routing are enabled out of the box.

## Everyday Commands

| Task | Command | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| Format & lint | `pnpm format` / `pnpm check` | Biome handles both formatting and linting. |
| Type safety | `pnpm typecheck` | Runs TypeScript across the entire workspace. |
| Tests | `pnpm test` | Uses Vitest; try `pnpm coverage` for HTML coverage reports. |
| Build | `pnpm build` | Executes the full Turborepo production pipeline. |
| Clean artifacts | `pnpm clean` | Useful before benchmarking or releasing. |

## Recommended Workflow

1. Start the local dev server with `pnpm web:dev`.
2. Implement changes in the relevant app or package.
3. Run `pnpm check` and `pnpm test` before opening a PR.
4. Craft conventional commits (e.g., `feat(web): add onboarding flow`) so the CI hooks pass without manual fixes.
